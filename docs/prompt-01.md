The objective is to launch an instance of mastodon that can be expanded upon over time in response to increased demand. it needs to be on google cloud platform and expressed as terraform. we will be setting up ci/cd on the terraform codebase using github actions and terraform cloud.

## Introduction

Mastodon is an open-source social networking platform that allows users to create and interact with microblogging communities. Deploying Mastodon on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) requires careful consideration of various technical aspects such as networking, security, monitoring, elasticity, performance, and cost optimization. This document outlines the overall architecture and addresses the concerns associated with deploying Mastodon on GCP using Terraform. Additionally, it covers the setup of CI/CD using GitHub Actions and Terraform Cloud for automated infrastructure provisioning.

## Architecture Overview

The proposed architecture for deploying Mastodon on GCP will consist of the following components:

1. **Compute Engine Instances**: The main application and database servers will be hosted on Compute Engine instances. The number of instances can be scaled up or down based on demand.

2. **Cloud SQL**: For the database backend, we will use Google Cloud SQL, a fully managed database service.

3. **Cloud Storage**: Mastodon requires object storage for media uploads. Google Cloud Storage will be used for this purpose.

4. **Load Balancer**: A managed load balancer will be set up to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances.

5. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: All resources will be deployed in a custom VPC to isolate them from external threats.

6. **Firewall Rules**: Network firewall rules will be configured to control traffic to and from the instances.

7. **Monitoring & Logging**: Monitoring and logging services like Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging will be set up to monitor the health and performance of the infrastructure.

8. **Auto Scaling**: Elasticity will be achieved using Managed Instance Groups (MIGs) to automatically scale the number of instances based on demand.

9. **Security**: HTTPS will be enforced using SSL certificates, and access to instances will be restricted using IAM roles and SSH keys.

10. **Cost Optimization**: Rightsizing, reserved instances, and monitoring of resource utilization will be implemented to optimize costs.

## Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Terraform will be used to define and manage the entire infrastructure as code. The Terraform configuration files will describe the GCP resources, networking setup, security configurations, and more.

## Networking

1. **VPC Setup**: Define a custom VPC network to isolate the resources.

2. **Subnets**: Create subnets within the VPC for Compute Engine instances, Cloud SQL, and other services.

3. **Firewall Rules**: Define firewall rules to allow specific inbound and outbound traffic to the instances.

4. **Load Balancer**: Set up a managed load balancer to distribute traffic across instances.

## Security

1. **HTTPS**: Enable HTTPS using SSL certificates to secure communications.

2. **IAM Roles**: Define appropriate IAM roles and permissions to control access to GCP resources.

3. **SSH Key Management**: Implement SSH key-based access to instances for enhanced security.

## Monitoring

1. **Google Cloud Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for infrastructure and application metrics.

2. **Google Cloud Logging**: Configure logs to be sent to Cloud Logging for centralized log management.

## Elasticity

1. **Managed Instance Groups (MIGs)**: Create MIGs to enable automatic scaling of instances based on demand.

## Performance

1. **Machine Types**: Choose appropriate machine types for Compute Engine instances based on performance requirements.

2. **Cloud SQL Tier**: Select the appropriate Cloud SQL tier based on the database workload.

## Cost Optimization

1. **Rightsizing**: Monitor resource utilization and rightsize instances to avoid unnecessary costs.

2. **Reserved Instances**: Utilize reserved instances for long-term cost savings.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Terraform Cloud

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Set up a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions to validate and test Terraform code.

2. **Terraform Cloud**: Configure Terraform Cloud to manage state files and perform automated deployments.

3. **Infrastructure Versioning**: Implement versioning for Terraform code to track changes and ensure consistency.

## Conclusion

By following the outlined architecture and addressing the technical concerns related to networking, security, monitoring, elasticity, performance, and cost optimization, you can deploy an instance of Mastodon on Google Cloud Platform. Utilizing Terraform and setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Terraform Cloud will streamline the infrastructure provisioning process and enable smooth expansion in response to increased demand over time. Always remember to review and update the infrastructure as the platform and requirements evolve.
