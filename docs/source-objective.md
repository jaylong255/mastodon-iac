Would you be able to provide a high level design, with diagrams, for a highly available cloud based architecture to host the new Mastodon environment? The design would need to cover the basic server needs (number and type of servers), load balancers, etc. We would deploy the systems with our code, in our AWS environment, with our security policies. Based on your message above would four to six hours be enough time? Does that all make sense? What do you think?
