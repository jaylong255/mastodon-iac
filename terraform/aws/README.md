# Architecture and Technical Considerations for Elastic High-Availability Mastodon Instance on AWS using Terraform and AWS Fargate

## Introduction

The objective of this document is to outline the overall architecture and technical concerns for deploying an elastic high-availability instance of Mastodon on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform and AWS Fargate. The solution will use containerization to enable easy scaling and manageability of the application. We will also set up CI/CD using GitHub Actions and Terraform Cloud to automate infrastructure provisioning. Emphasis will be placed on networking, security, monitoring, elasticity, performance, and cost optimization.

> ## Notes on IaC
> Terraform is an invaluable tool for managing complex cloud infrastructure. As your system grows in complexity, it becomes increasingly difficult to reproduce working architecture accurately and effectively. It also becomes difficult to track the changes that people make to your infrastucture in the console.

> By expressing all of our resources as code, you will be able to quickly duplicate identical infrastructure, your ability to track what changes have been made will be near instant and automated, and your time will likely gain a deeper insight and understanding into how all of your resources work together to power your app.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture for the elastic high-availability Mastodon instance on AWS will consist of the following components:

1. **AWS Fargate**: This serverless compute engine will orchestrate containerized Mastodon application instances, enabling auto-scaling and high availability.

2. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: A fully managed PostgreSQL database service for the Mastodon application backend. Configure your app to support readonly replica endpoints for horizontal scaling of readers. Set thresholds to scale the writer vertically.

3. **Amazon ElastiCache**: A fully managed Redis service for in-memory caching.

4. **Amazon S3**: For media uploads and other object storage requirements.

5  **CloudFront CDN**: Content delivery network to speed up performance with edge caching, and for protection against DDoS attacks with Amazon Shield.

6. **AWS Elastic Load Balancing**: An elastic load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple Fargate instances.

7. **AWS Web ACL and Web Application Firewall**: Requests from the web will go through the WAF to protect from malicious and enforce security rules.

8. **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: All resources will be deployed within a custom VPC network to ensure isolation and security.

9. **Security Groups**: Network security groups will be configured to control traffic between services and secure access points.

10. **Secrets Manager**: Manage secure encrypted environment variables in the secret store for quick, secure retrieval when service clusters launch.


> **A few words on state:** One way of thinking about your infrastructure while you are planning your app is to consider where state is managed and keep it decoupled from your application codebase containers. Anything that stores a file, saves a session, persists data or otherwise manages any type of state needs to be done outside of the app container and in an elastic resource.  

## Networking

### Elastic Load Balancing

The AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) will distribute incoming traffic across multiple AWS Fargate instances. The load balancer will be configured with health checks to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic, providing high availability and improved performance for users accessing Mastodon.

### Security Groups

1. **VPC Security Group**: Ingress and egress rules will be defined in the VPC security group to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic at the network level. All traffic coming from the web will have to go through the Web Application Firewall and the Load Balancer on the public subnet. Developers must use temporary bastion instances to interact with resources on the VPC. All other resources will be on the private subnet.

2. **Service-to-Service Communication**: Security groups will allow secure communication between the Mastodon application on Fargate and the other services it depends on like the ElastiCache Redis cluster, the media bucket in S3, or the RDS database instance.

### Securely Interacting with Services

1. **Secure Shell (SSH)**: For secure shell access to instances, IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles will be used to control and audit SSH access.

2. **Database Access**: Database access to Amazon RDS will be protected using SSL/TLS encryption and IAM roles for security.

3. **AWS CLI - ECS Execute Command** Enable developers to interact with Fargate-powered environments using `aws ecs exectute-command`.

### IAM Roles and Policies
1. Use well-definied policies using the principle of least privilege. Do not give a user or resource more permission than it needs to do its job.

2. Use Terraform to track and manage policies. Feel good about spending a little extra time and making a properly secure policy. By using Terraform, you can reuse policies expressed as code.

## Elasticity

AWS Fargate offers automatic scaling based on CPU and memory utilization or custom-defined metrics. It will dynamically scale the number of container instances up or down to handle demand. This feature ensures optimal performance and cost-effectiveness by automatically adjusting resources based on load.

## Performance, Reliability, and Cost Optimization

### Automated Scaling Thresholds

AWS Fargate allows setting up automated scaling policies based on predefined CPU and memory utilization thresholds. You can define minimum and maximum tasks to ensure the application scales up to handle peak loads and scales down during periods of low traffic. This helps maintain performance and reliability while optimizing costs by avoiding over-provisioning.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Incident Response & Troubleshooting

1. **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitor application and infrastructure performance in real-time with Amazon CloudWatch. Set up alarms to notify administrators of potential issues, ensuring a proactive incident response. Connect alerts to autoscaling thresholds so that resources scale on their own as they notify you.

2. **AWS CloudTrail**: Utilize AWS CloudTrail to record API calls and track user activity, helping to troubleshoot and analyze root causes during incidents.

3. **Terraform IaC**: Use drift detection features in Terraform to track changes made outside of the IaC workflow.

### Planning Future Improvements

Carefully collecting and monitoring resource metric data will enable uis to make informed decisions about how to optimize our resources over time. There is no way we're going to be able to predict what our optimal configuration is, but if we collect the data we can adjust and adapt intelligently as demand changes.

## Conclusion

The proposed architecture for an elastic high-availability Mastodon instance on AWS leverages AWS Fargate for container orchestration, automatic scaling, and high availability. Terraform is used to define and manage the entire infrastructure as code, and CI/CD is established with GitHub Actions and Terraform Cloud for automated infrastructure provisioning. Emphasis is placed on networking, security, monitoring, elasticity, performance, and cost optimization to ensure a robust and scalable deployment. With a secure, scalable, and monitored infrastructure, the Mastodon instance can seamlessly expand over time in response to increased demand while maintaining high performance, reliability, and cost efficiency.
